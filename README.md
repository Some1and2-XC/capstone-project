# Capstone Project
## Tech Decisions
This project is built on top of pythons `flask` package (backend) as well as javascripts `react` packages (frontend) in addition to a SQL database to keep track of data.
 - react does use the `react-router-dom` package to do client side routing. 
 - python is used for API routing.

## Installation Steps
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (make sure you check add python to path on the first screen)
2. `git pull https://github.com/Some1and2-XC/capstone-project.git`
2. Run the CLI command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `python -m pip install ...` if pip isn't recognized as a command)
2. Run the CLI command `npm install`
2. Run the CLI command `npm run start` in the pulled directory to start the frontend server
2. In a different terminal emulator run the CLI command `npm run server:dev` to start the backend server
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser


# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and this section was auto generated (but still useful).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
